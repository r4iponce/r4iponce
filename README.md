# Hi, i'm Ada ðŸ’…

I am currently a student in computer science.

I am interested in network, system automation, dev, self-hosting and free software. I made some stuff for [GnousEU](https://gnous.eu).

I principally write in Go, Python, and a little of Kotlin.

You can contact me at [ada@gnous.eu](mailto:ada@gnous.eu). I also have a website : [ada.wf](https://ada.wf)
