# Hi, i'm Ada ðŸ’…

I am currently a student in computer science and system adminstrator.

I have some interest in network, automation, dev. I like free software (!= open source). I also do some stuff for GnousEU

I don't really use github, i prefer decentralised and selfhosted solution, checkout [git.gnous.eu/ada](https://git.gnous.eu/ada) instead.

You can contact me at [ada@gnous.eu](mailto:ada@gnous.eu)
